GitHub Feeds Burner
===================

A open-source feed-burner for github users. You may read public
activities of the github users you are connected to (i.e. followers
and following) all at one place.

**Note**:

1. The initial version is using
[public api](https://developer.github.com/v3) access, which is
[restricted](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/)
(i.e in number of requests). If you get RateLimit Error, this
must be it.

2. GitHub will reset the bans a short while stated in Error.
I look forward to add login to increase the number of requests,
where merit will be the popularity of this repository
(as in stars and PRs).

Currently I'm looking for angular (1.x) developers who can add more
features. Don't raise issues, just Fork & PR.
